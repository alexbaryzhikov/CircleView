# CircleView

A Metal-based rendering project that demonstrates fundamental GPU programming concepts through the implementation of a circular shape renderer.

## Overview

This project showcases the use of Apple's Metal framework to create a GPU-accelerated rendering pipeline. It focuses on generating and displaying a polygonal approximation of a circle, demonstrating key concepts of Metal renderig pipeline.

## Key Features

- Metal view setup for GPU-rendered content display
- Custom render pipeline configuration
- Vertex and fragment shader implementation
- Polygonal circle approximation generation
- Efficient GPU-based rendering
